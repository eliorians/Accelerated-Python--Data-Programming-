Problem 1:
GaussianNB for 94% 
some overlap

Problem 2:
KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5) for ~90%
some overlap

Problem 3:
MLPClassifier for ~89%
some overlap

Problem 4:
LogisticRegression for ~84%
high overlap

Problem 5:
KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors= 5) for ~89%
high overlap

Problem 6:
DecisionTreeClassifier() for ~100%
no overlap

Problem 7:
KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5) for ~68%
high overlap

Problem 8:
DecisionTreeClassifier() for ~100%
no overlap

Problem 9:
KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5) for ~99%
no overlap

Problem 10:
LogisticRegression(random_state=0) for ~90%
some overlap

Problem 11:
MLPClassifier(alpha=1, max_iter=1000) for ~92%
some overlap

Problem 12:
KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3) for ~90%
some overlap

In most cases, it seemed that OVERLAP was preventing 100% accuracy. 
In problems 6, 8, 9 there were clear boundries.
In problems 4, 5, 7 it was clusters that overlapped one another.
